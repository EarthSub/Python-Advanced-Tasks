The Animal class (abstract) should take, attributes, a name, an age, and a gender. It should have 2 methods: repr() and make_sound().

The Dog class should inherit and implement the Animal class. Its repr() method should return "This is {name}.
{name} is a {age} year old {gender} {class}". The dog sound is "Woof!".

The Cat class should inherit and implement the Animal class. Its repr() method should return "This is {name}
{name} is a {age} year old {gender} {class}". The cat sounds, "Meow meow!".

The Kitten class should inherit and implement the Cat class. Its gender is "Female", and its sound is "Meow".

The Tomcat class should inherit and implement the Cat class. Its gender is "Male", and its sound is "Hiss".

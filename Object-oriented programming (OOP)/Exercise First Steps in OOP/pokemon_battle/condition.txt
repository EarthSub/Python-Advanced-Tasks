You are tasked to create two classes: a Pokemon class in the pokemon.py file and a Trainer class in the trainer.py file.

The Pokemon class should receive a name (string) and health (int) upon initialization. It should also have a method
called pokemon_details that returns the information about the pokemon: "{pokemon_name} with health {pokemon_health}"

The Trainer class should receive a name (string). The Trainer should also have an attribute pokemons (list, empty by default). The Trainer has three methods:

- add_pokemon(pokemon: Pokemon)
    o Adds the pokemon to the collection and returns "Caught {pokemon_name} with health {pokemon_health}". Hint: use the pokemon's details method.
    o If the pokemon is already in the collection, return "This pokemon is already caught"
    o Hint: to import the Pokemon class, you should add "from project.pokemon import Pokemon"
- release_pokemon(pokemon_name: string)
    o Check if you have a pokemon with that name and remove it from the collection. In the end, returns "You have released {pokemon_name}"
    o If there is no pokemon with that name in the collection, return "Pokemon is not caught"
- trainer_data()
    o The method returns the information about the trainer and his pokemon's collection in the format:
    "Pokemon Trainer {trainer_name} Pokemon count {the amount of pokemon caught} - {pokemon_details1}
    ...
    - {pokemon_detailsN}"


                                Examples

Test Code                                                           Output

pokemon = Pokemon("Pikachu", 90)                                    Pikachu with health 90
print(pokemon.pokemon_details())                                    Caught Pikachu with health 90
trainer = Trainer("Ash")                                            Caught Charizard with health 110
print(trainer.add_pokemon(pokemon))                                 This pokemon is already caught
second_pokemon = Pokemon("Charizard", 110)                          You have released Pikachu
print(trainer.add_pokemon(second_pokemon))                          Pokemon is not caught
print(trainer.add_pokemon(second_pokemon))                          Pokemon Trainer Ash
print(trainer.release_pokemon("Pikachu"))                           Pokemon count 1
print(trainer.release_pokemon("Pikachu"))                           - Charizard with health 110
print(trainer.trainer_data())

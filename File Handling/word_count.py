# Write a program that reads a list of words from the file words.
# txt and finds how many times each of the words is contained in another file text.txt.
# Matching should be case-insensitive.

# The results should be written into other text files. Sort the words by frequency in descending order.


#                                             Examples

# words.txt                   input.txt                                           output.txt

# quick is fault              -I was quick to judge him, but it                   is - 3
#                             wasn't his fault.                                   quick - 2
#                             -Is this some kind of joke?! Is it?                 fault - 1
#                             -Quick, hide hereâ€¦It is safer.

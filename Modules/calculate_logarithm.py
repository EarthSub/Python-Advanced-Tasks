# Write a program that prints the calculated logarithm of any given number

# Input

#     · On the first line, you will receive the number (an integer)
#     · On the second line, you will receive a number, which is the logarithm base.
#         It can be either a number or the word "natural"

# The output should be formatted to the 2nd decimal digit


#             Examples

# Input                       Output

# 10                          2.30
# natural

# Input                       Output

# 10                          1.00
# 10

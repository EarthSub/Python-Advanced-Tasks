# Create a program that will receive commands until the command "End". The commands can be:

#     路 "Create-{file_name}" - Creates the given file with empty content. If the file already exists,
#         remove the existing text in it (as if the file is created again)
#     路 "Add-{file_name}-{content}" - Append the content and a new line after it.
#         If the file does not exist, create it, and add the content
#     路 "Replace-{file_name}-{old_string}-{new_string}" - Open the file and replace all the occurrences of the old string
#         with the new string. If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"
#     路 "Delete-{file_name}" - Delete the file. If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"


#                     Example

# Input                                   Comment

# Create-file.txt                         The first command creates the empty file
# Add-file.txt-First Line                 After the first and second Add command, the content is:
# Add-file.txt-Second Line                First Line
# Replace-random.txt-Some-some            Second Line
# Replace-file.txt-First-1st              On the first Replace command, an error must occur
# Replace-file.txt-Second-2nd             After the next two Replace commands, the content is:
# Delete-random.txt                       1st Line
# Delete-file.txt                         2nd Line
# End                                     After the first Delete command, an error occurs
#                                         Finally, the 'file.txt' file is deleted

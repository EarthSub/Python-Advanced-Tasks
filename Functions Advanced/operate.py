# Write a function called operate that receives an operator ("+", "-", "*" or "/") as Ð° first argument and multiple numbers (integers) as
# additional arguments (*args). The function should return the result of the operator applied to all the numbers.
# For more clarification, see the examples below.

# Submit only your function in the Judge system.

# Note: Be careful when you have multiplication and division


#                                         Examples

# print(operate("+", 1, 2, 3))            6                               1 + 2 + 3 = 6
